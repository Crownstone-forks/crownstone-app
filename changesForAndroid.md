@react-native-community/slider updated

Added handles to most bridge methods.

Added nativeEvents:
"connectedToPeripheral"       // dataType: string --> handle of Crownstone  
"connectedToPeripheralFailed" // dataType: string --> handle of Crownstone        
"disconnectedFromPeripheral"  // dataType: string --> handle of Crownstone       

Connect bridge method now returns the Crownstone's operation mode:
"unknown"
"setup"
"operation"
"dfu"

Add cancelConnectionRequest(handle) bridge method which will fail the connection promise with error "CONNECTION_CANCELLED". If this fails due to timeout, throw error "CANCEL_PENDING_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT". Other errors will be treated as bugs to solve (for now).

Move to the HERMES engine
https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes

Updated to RN 0.64.2

- remove setMeshChannel bridge method. this is from the old mesh.

- Updated data type for this event:
    crownstoneAdvertisementReceived: "crownstoneAdvertisementReceived",   // data type = crownstoneAdvertisementSummary, this is only the handle. // Any advertisement, verified and unverified from crownstones.
    
Setup command will no longer receive meshAccessAddress. Hardcode into lib if required for legacy.

Turn on mesh command data changed. It is now a list of stone short ids.
turnOnMesh(handle: string, arrayOfStoneIds: number[])  

If a command fails due to not being connected to a crownstone (anymore), throw this error: "NOT_CONNECTED"

Added crash method to bridge

Updated sentry config (Contact Alex for details.)

Added setTimeViaBroadcast parameter enableTimeBasedNonce (boolean) to the end of the param list. False means use CAFEBABE instead of time as validation nonce.
This sets a customValidationNonce of 0xCAFEBABE
